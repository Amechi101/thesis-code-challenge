# Design Alterations

### Removed Hamburger menu from desktop view
In the original design, there was a hamburger menu shown on the desktop view, I removed it because typically in web design patterns implementation of a hamburger menu appear during tablet and/or mobile views.

### Underneath the signup form made the "Terms of service" text onto a singular line
The "Terms of Service" text was on a new line within the design so I adjusted the text to display on a singular line.

### Changed Header & Footer links
The original navigation on the footer had a "Contact" link and as well "Contacts" link within the header. I removed the "Contact" link from the footer and made "Contacts" in the header singular (i.e. "Contact"). The reasoning is I felt the text "Contacts" was a tad confusing. The first question I asked myself was does this company have multiple contacts? But judging from the landing page "Contact" would seem suitable to use as a user would be contacting only one company and anyone at the company which is the "Stamp".

Afterwhich, making the aforementioned adjustment, I removed the "Contact" link from the footer as there is no need for a duplicate "Contact" link since one exist within the header.

### Aligned header links to the left near the logo
The header links were aligned to the center and I changed them to be aligned to the left near the logo. The reasoning behind this was I felt the for Desktop View & Tablet Views the links centered on the page made the page seem more cluttered so aligning to the left next to the logo gave the page more breathing room for the content in the middle to be focused on more easily, which is one of the most important parts of the landing page.

### Didn't add icons on the signup form
On the form, I did not add the reveal password icon and the small arrow icon on the signup button. I felt those were additional things that didn't add anything of importance to the page and could be done without.
